VFPX Deployment automates the steps needed to include your project in the Thor Check for Updates (CFU) dialogue
so you can easily install your project and update to the latest version without having to clone your project's repository or manually download and extract a ZIP file.

## External information
See the great article [Anatomy of a VFPX Project](https://doughennig.blogspot.com/2023/05/anatomy-of-vfpx-project.html) by Doug Hennig.
It shows the setup of *VFPX related data* and *Thor* in two chapters.   
Since version 1.1.08536 this tool merges both, but the article gives a good idea.
